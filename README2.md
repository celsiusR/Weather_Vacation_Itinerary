## Traveler Monde-Touree

Our traveler Monde from New York is an adventurer with all inhabitable locations on planet earth being his playground. He has decided to take a vacation and tour the land. His pet peeve is warm weather with location being no barrier. He sets of with identifying cities across the globe. He uses python to obtain a collection of cities as his potential destinations. He decides on a upper and lower boundary of latitudes and longitudes and then meticulously develops a list of cities which he compiles in "Weather_Database/WeatherPy_database.csv

## Vacation with a Hotel

However, not all locations have accommodations. Monde being the type who relies on a comfortable bed prefers a good hotel with modern amenities. So he decides to use the database of cities he has created and   then find hotels within those cities. He again uses python to obtain a list of cities with hotels. This time he will also include the weather conditions within those cities - "Current Description". He will then plot these using the google maps api and gmaps with its marker functions.

His analysis is accurate and the sample of ten rows of data is displayed below.

However it is time for Monde to have a visual display so he can point and click. He gmaps from google and plots a marker layer for each city with hotels as shown below. Our traveler has a choice of destinations as shown in the figure below for the temperatures in the range of 75 degrees to 90 degrees. This fig shows the detail.

## Vacation Itinerary

As he scrolls and magnifies the map his attention is drawn towards the continent of Australia. He zeroes in on Australia, famous for its natural wonders, wide-open spaces, beaches, deserts, "The Bush", and "The Outback".  The cities of Carnarvon, Kununurra, Mackay, Broken Hill cover a good distance across Australia. See figure below. While it is an ambitious travel route it is accessible via driving, bicycling or walking. These are good options to provide a variety of travel modes between these destinations. Besides he is travelling light given the weather conditions in those cities. He has options being an avid hiker and a bicyclist. The cities listed below suit his spirit.

He knows this requires meticulous planning and advance reservations to the lodging facilities available at these cities. The hotels Hospitality Carnarvon, Hotel Kununurra, International Lodge Motel, and Royal Exchange Hotel are hotels found at these locations.  The climate at these locations is suitable and the clothing gear he plans on carrying with him will be reasonable given the temperatures range from 78 degrees to 82 degrees in these cities.

Given the information at hand, the traveler proceeds to reach out and reserve stays at these hotels.

Monde is excited that he has been able to use the weather api and the Google maps api to fulfil his travel urge. His plans are set and what remains are the Australian VISA preparations and the COVID precautions. While an expert in Python, he will not need to perform an extensive data analysis for these activities. The Australian embassy in New York will be his single point of contact. 

Lets check in on our weary traveler on the exploits through Australia after he returns back to New York.
